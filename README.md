## Project Title : Hostel In-Time Entry System

The Hostel In-Time Entry System is a simple Python script designed to manage and monitor the entry timings of hostel residents. The system checks whether a resident is requesting entry within the allowed time frame and grants or denies permission accordingly. If the entry is attempted outside of the permitted hours, the system provides contact information for the warden.

### Features : 
- **Entry Time Validation**: The system checks if the current time is within the predefined hostel entry hours (6:00 AM to 10:00 PM).
- **Automatic Permission Granting**: If the current time falls within the allowed entry hours, the system grants permission to enter the hostel and notifies the user of the expected entry time.
- **Warden Contact Information**: If entry is requested outside the allowed hours, the system denies permission and provides the warden's contact details for further assistance.

### Technologies Used : 
- **Python**: The project is implemented using Python, utilizing the datetime module for time management.
